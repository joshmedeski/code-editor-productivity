Code editor productivity is a site for people who want to improve their overall productivity with their favorite code editor.

There are plenty of arguments to which code editor is "best" but it all comes down to personal choice and mastery of the system you choose.

I've moved around and used many code editors in my time as a programmer. This blog is meant to share my experiences and how I use different tools to be more effective and efficient as a programmer.
